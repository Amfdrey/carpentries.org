<h1>Our Instructor Community</h1>

  Instructor whose details do not appear here, but you would like to be listed, please

  your profile public via the checkbox option within the record. To log in, select <b>Login with GitHub</b> and make and save your
  changes. If we don't yet have your GitHub username in your instructor record, please
  <a href="mailto:team@carpentries.org">email it to the team</a> so they can add it and let you log in. If you add/have added your Twitter, GitHub, ORCiD,
  and personal website URL to your AMY record, they will appear as part of
  your record here. <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/workshop_administration/amy_manual.html#instructor-login">Find more information on AMY</a>.</p>
