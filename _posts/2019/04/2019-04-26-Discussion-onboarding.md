In the past we had instructor discussion sessions that took place twice a week and provided a platform where experienced and no9vice instructors could discuss previous and upcoming workshops, and share challenges as well as victories with the community as well as the instructor checkouts.

These sessions had a few challenges that included timezone differences, available slots for checkouts and debrief to name but a few. Thus we foudn it difficult to meet all the demands for the discussion sessions, and felt the need to relax the discussion session requirement for checkouts. The community however, felt it neccesary to keep the discussion sessions as a requirement, but in a different way with multiple pathways to particiapte.

Thus the Community Discussions were introduced, these discussion sessions not only focusses on Pre- and Post- Workshop Discussion but also added Themed Discussion Session that focusses on a specific topic, and also introduced Carpentries Conversations that provide the oppportunity to discuss new developments and programs within the Carpentries.

This provides the opportunity for new as well as experienced instructors to ask questions pertaining to specific topics as well as the checkout procedures. The community discussions also allow for a bigger number of participants that solved a lot of the issues previously experience with the discussion sessions.

One of the bigger challenges we face at the moment is to get instructors to sign up as hosts for the discussion sessions. The biggest challenge is not the willingness of the community it is the fear of the unknown, the questions that we all have, the "What-ifs."

Lets have a look at some of these:

What if I'm hosting a discussion and there are no pre/post workshop debriefs? 

You could start by introducing the session and what is should be about, you could also give some feedback on your own experience in previous workshops and/or upcoming workshops that you are apart of.

What if I do not know the answer to someone's questions and no one in the room does either? 

It is totally fine if you do not know all the answers, in sucha situation you are welcome to refer the question to someone within the carpentries communiyt that will have the answer. If not, you could always contact Martin Dreyer or Kari Jordan with your question.

What if the host/co-host has a poor internet connection and are unable to communicate? What if Zoom fails to work (e.g. your internet connection fails?)

It is very important to test your internet connection beforehand and to make sure that you as a host is able to communicate, the host is the session leader and should have a stable connection. If however when you test your connection you find that you do not have a good connection reach out to the community to see if someone could take over as host for that session.

What if a group from a single site has connectivity issues?

You could ask them to try and reconnect, however if they keep on having issues and cannot participate in the session please ask them to reschedule.

What if no one shows up?

If no one shows up simply wait for a few minutes, send out reminder emails to the signed
up participants, and then fill in the post discussion questionnaire and indicate that no one showed up for your session.

What if someone talks too much?

Limit the amount of time that you give participants to ask and answer questions.

What if there is no co-host/note taker and the session is fully booked? 

As a host you are more than welcome to take a few notes, there is no need to take down every singel thing that is said. Note down important points, links to usefull informatio is always important. Also encourage the particiapnts to take notes.

What if someone joins in late? 

Depending on how late the person joins, you could simply welcome them and ask them to introduce themselves to the rest of the participants.

What if someone does not have a headset and can’t control their background noise?

As a host you will have the privelages to mute other participants, or you could simply ask the person directly to mute their mike.

What if I forget to complete the host questionnaire? 

The participants will not have updated profiles for the checkout sessions and it will take a lot of administration to solve. Please remember to fill in the form directly afterwards.

What if someone breaks the Code of Conduct? What if someone had a report of misconduct?

In the case that this happens The Caprentries has a set of [guidelines](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/incident-response.html) that can be followed.

What if one person doesn’t say/contribute to the conversation?

Always try and encourage participation, this can be done by asking them a question or asking them their thoughts on a specific topic of conversation. There is also a point in the agenda that allows you as host to talk to participants and ask them each for a specific question that they need answering.

What if someone asks me to join the instructor checkout session and it is already full?

You could email the host and ask if it would be ok with them if you joined the session although it is already fully booked.

What if someone is loud/obnoxious and/or talks down to other people?

It is very impoartant to remind everyone of the [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/index_coc.html) within which The Carpentries function at the very beginning of the session. This will be a clear violation of this and you could ask the person to leave.

What if I am having trouble understanding the attendees?

You could ask the participant to type their questions in the etherpad so that you can read them and then answer them, this will also make note taking much easier. you could also ask them to speak-up if the microphone is too soft.

Still have questions that need answering?Feel free to send [Martin Dreyer](mailto:amfdrey@gmail.com) an email.
